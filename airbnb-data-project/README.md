# :houses: Airbnb Data Exploration & Visualization Project

## About the Project
In this project, I am exploring Airbnb data for Los Angeles using PostgreSQL and creating a dashboard of visualizations using Tableau. The data is obtained from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), and there are two datasets used: `listings` and `calendar`. 

## Datasets
- **`listings`:** contains data on the listings available in Los Angeles as of June 6, 2023
- **`calendar`:** contains data on the price, availability and other details from the listing's calendar for each day of the next 365 days as of June 6, 2023			
  
## Information to Explore
1. What is the revenue per day?
2. How many neighbourhoods are there in Los Angeles?
3. How many hosts are there in each neighbourhood?
4. How many listings are there in each neighbourhood?
5. What is the average price of listings in each neighbourhood?
6. How many listings of each room type (private room, entire home, etc) are there?
7. What is the average price per room type listing?
8. How many listings of each bedroom (1 bdrm, 2 bdrm, etc) are there? 
9. What is the average price per bedroom listing?
