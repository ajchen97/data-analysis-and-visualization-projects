# :houses: Airbnb Data Exploration & Visualization Project

## About the Project
In this project, I am exploring Airbnb data for Los Angeles using PostgreSQL and creating a dashboard of visualizations using Tableau. The data is obtained from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), and there are two datasets used: `listings` and `neighbourhoods`. 

## Datasets
- **`listings`:** contains data on the listings available in Los Angeles
- **`neighbourhoods`:** contains data related to the neighbourhoods in Los Angeles
  
## Information to Explore
