## [Case Study #3](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/) - Foodie-Fi Results

### A. Customer Journey
**1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. (Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!)**
```sql 
SELECT s.customer_id, 
    s.plan_id,
    s.start_date,
    p.plan_name,
    p.price
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s 
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
```

### C. Challenge Payment Question
**1. The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:**
  - monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
  - upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
  - upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
  - once a customer churns they will no longer make payments


### D. Outside The Box Questions
**1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?**

**2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?**

**3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?**

**4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in 
the survey?**

**5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?**
